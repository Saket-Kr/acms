"""Coverage validation for fact consolidation.

After the LLM returns consolidation actions, this module checks that
every prior fact is accounted for — either by an explicit source_fact_id
reference or by keyword overlap with an action's content.

Validation is advisory (logs warnings, never raises), since imperfect
consolidation is better than no consolidation.
